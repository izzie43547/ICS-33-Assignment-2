# Generative AI Usage Documentation

## Overview
This document details the use of generative AI (GitHub Copilot) in the development of this traffic light simulation project.

## AI Assistance Details

### Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot

### Prompts and Outputs

#### 1. Initial Implementation
**Prompt**: "Implement a traffic light simulation in Python with these requirements: [list of requirements]"
**Output**: Initial class structure and basic implementation was generated.
**Modifications Made**:
- Restructured the code to better separate concerns
- Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Implemented proper state management

#### 2. Test Case Generation
**Prompt**: "Generate unit tests for the TrafficLight class"
**Output**: Basic test cases were provided
**Modifications Made**:
- Enhanced test coverage
- Added edge case testing
- Improved test assertions

#### 3. Bug Fixing
**Prompt**: "The traffic light transitions are not working correctly when time_remaining is 0"
**Output**: Suggested fixes for the update() method
**Modifications Made**:
- Implemented proper state transition logic
- Added immediate transition handling
- Ensured time_remaining is properly updated

### Percentage of AI-Generated Code
Approximately 40% of the final code was AI-suggested, with significant modifications and improvements made to:
- Ensure correctness
- Improve code quality
- Add documentation
- Handle edge cases

## Learning Outcomes
1. Effective use of AI as a pair programming tool
2. Importance of understanding generated code
3. Need for thorough testing of AI-suggested code
4. Value of code reviews for AI-generated code

## Ethical Considerations
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and understood
- Proper attribution is given to AI assistance
- Final implementation represents original work with AI assistance

## Conclusion
Generative AI was a valuable tool in accelerating development, but human oversight and testing remained crucial for ensuring a correct and robust implementation.
